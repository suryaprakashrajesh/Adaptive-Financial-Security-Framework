The increasing demand for faster and more secure banking transactions has driven
innovation in the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) systems. This project
presents a Smart QR Based ATM system designed to enhance user experience by
significantly reducing transaction times while ensuring robust security measures.
The traditional method of cash withdrawal, which involves entering a Personal
Identification Number (PIN) followed by selecting the desired amount, often
proves to be time-consuming and prone to security risks.
Our proposed solution introduces a mobile application that empowers users to
initiate cash withdrawals seamlessly. Users can log into the application, specify
the desired withdrawal amount, and generate a temporary PIN that adds an extra
layer of security against ATM scams. Following this, a Quick Response (QR)
code is generated, encapsulating the transaction details. This QR code can then be
scanned at the ATM terminal, allowing for quick and secure cash withdrawal in
under 30 seconds.
To facilitate this system, we will leverage Python's image processing techniques
for QR code generation and scanning, ensuring that the implementation is both
effective and user-friendly. This project aims to redefine the ATM experience,
aligning it with modern security needs while delivering unprecedented
convenience to users. Through this innovative approach, we envision a banking
landscape that prioritizes efficiency and safety, ultimately enabling users to
access their funds with confidence and ease.
